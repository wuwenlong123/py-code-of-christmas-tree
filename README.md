# py-code-of-christmas-tree
An unsuccessfully received Christmas tree code（python）. It's my gift for a girl at Christmas, using the picture she drew to create this code.

Maybe it's simple and doesn't take much effort, but the person I care about fail to see it ultimately.

Wish her see it one day.
